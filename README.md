# SPPU-Sem-IV-Practicals
SPPU 2019 Pattern Computer Engineering Semester 4 / IV Practical Codes For DSAL. These are the practicals performed & coded by me, with inputs & knowledge from the internet (obviously). I don't suggest you to copy paste these & submit, rather use it as a base to study the structure of the program, tinker with it, make it your own - that's how you learn. These programs work according to my understanding, if you encounter any errors feel free to reach out. All The Best!
